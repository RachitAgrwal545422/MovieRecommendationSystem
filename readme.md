<p>There are 3 major types of recommendation systems:-</p>
<ul>
  <li>Content Based</li>
  <li>Collaborative Based</li>
  <li>Hybrid </li>
</ul>
<br/>
In content based we recommend based on the content of the item but in Collaborative we recommend based on the user and item similarity.Hybrid is the mixture of both.
<br/>
We will use content based filtering in this project.
<br/>
