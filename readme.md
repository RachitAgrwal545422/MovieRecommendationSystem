<p>There are 3 major types of recommendation systems:-</p>
<- Content Based
- Collaborative Based
- Hybrid 
>
<br/>
In content based we recommend based on the content of the item but in Collaborative we recommend based on the user and item similarity.Hybrid is the mixture of both.
<br/>
We will use content based filtering in this project.
<br/>
###### Flow of the project
<br/>
Data -> Preprocessing -> Model -> web deployment

<br/>Here to work on deployment part we will use streamlit library.
<br/>To install streamlit just use
`pip install streamlit`

And then to use this library and to run the project:-
`streamlit run app.py`
